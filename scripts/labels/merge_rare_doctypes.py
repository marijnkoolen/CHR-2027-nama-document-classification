"""
Merges rare document_type classes into a single, per-(layout_type,
functional_category) "Other" bucket, so the sequence model's doctype head
isn't trying to learn from classes with only a handful of training
examples. Of this project's 36 real doctype classes, 17 have fewer than 10
training examples and several have exactly 1 - those can't realistically be
learned from that few examples, and contribute large, noisy per-example
loss whenever they appear, which (see train.py's --loss-weight-doctype)
plausibly drags down the other three heads too, since all four task losses
are summed into one shared gradient.

Rarity is determined from the TRAIN split's counts only where a split
column is available (never val/test - this is purely a decision about
what's learnable from the training data, not something the evaluation set
should influence), then the SAME mapping is applied to every split, so
val/test are evaluated in the same merged label space the model is trained
on - not silently dropped, which is what would happen otherwise (a
val/test row whose original label vanished from the train-derived class
vocabulary is just ignored during evaluation). If split_col isn't given or
isn't present (e.g. run on merge_annotations.py's output, upstream of any
split assignment), rarity is determined from every row instead.

--count-by {pages,pdfs} (default pages) picks what "rare" is counted in.
pages (the default) targets learnability - a class needs enough labeled
examples to be worth its own head output. pdfs targets split-assignment
feasibility instead: a class split across only 1-2 distinct PDFs can never
appear in all of train/val/test no matter how splits are assigned (a PDF's
pages all go to one split), regardless of how many total pages it has -
use this before assign_stratified_splits.py, so every remaining class has
enough distinct PDFs to plausibly be distributed across all three splits.

Each rare doctype is merged into "Other ({layout_type}, {functional_category})"
using its own (dominant) layout/functional combination - not one flat
"Other" bucket - so classes that are rare for different reasons (e.g. a
rare form vs. a rare letter) don't get lumped together just for both being
rare. This also matches what flag_prediction_errors.py already treats as
each doctype's defining signature.

Usage (cached-embeddings manifest):
    python scripts/labels/merge_rare_doctypes.py \\
        --manifest data/embeddings_text_xlm_roberta_base/embeddings_manifest.tsv \\
        --out data/embeddings_text_xlm_roberta_base/embeddings_manifest_merged.tsv \\
        --min-count 10

    # or a live raw-image manifest (adjust column names to match):
    python scripts/labels/merge_rare_doctypes.py \\
        --manifest data/labels/dossier_labels.tsv --out data/labels/dossier_labels_merged.tsv \\
        --min-count 10 --doctype-col document_type --layout-col layout_type \\
        --functional-col functional_category --split-col split
